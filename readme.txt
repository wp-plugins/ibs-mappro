Comprehensive map editor and viewers for the traveling journalist

== Description ==
IBS Mappro plugin is a comprehensive map creator, editor, and viewer generator using the Google Maps API v3 supporting kml, kmz, and gpx map files. 
=Shortcodes=
Though Wordpress shortcodes IBS Mappro generates map viewers for posts and pages on your website. Included in the administation facilities is a shortcode generator to help produce the right map viewer for your posts.
=Place markers=
Perhaps unique to this plugin is the ability to add marker icon libraries and customize the marker icon palette. And for the Garmin GPX files the plugin provides the ability to map icon images to the GPX symbol names.
Place markers, besides having selectable and distinguishing icon images, can include in their description links and images along with text created with a robust editor.
=Route creation=
Map routes are created by defining the route path through a series of points and between the points can follow roads or if bushwacking across county edit point by point.
Optionally routes may be created using the Google Direction service which will yield cue sheets that cane stored with the map data. The editor also provides for printing of the cue sheets.
=Elevation profiles=
Elevation profiles may be displayed for individual route segments and the profile tracked on the map.
=Email tracking=
With the IBS Mailbox plugin (to be released soon) markers may be set up on the map and reposition by email postings.
=Notable editing features=
* switch travel direction for a route segment or the entire map.
* import any number of maps into the map editor. They will be merged together.
* save to desktop or save to the server map folder.
* edit at the line level with waypoint marker clustering.
* output GPX files with route or tracks.
* combine or split route segments.
* route segments can combine different modes of travel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**How do I draw a map?** Staring at the blank map editor there is no clue where to begin creating a map. On the left side of the map editor there is a "list area" and there is a link that says "Route." Click that link and move your mouse over the map and the cursor changes to a cross hair and a small meesage box that say "Start route" appears. Click on the map where the route is to begin. The message box now says "extend route." Click the next point for your route and continue until your route is completed.
Dismiss the "extend route" by a right mouse click or click the reset button.
**I have a map how do I show it on my post?** if your map has a url (http or https) address head right on over to the Shortcode tab and add your map address in the url="" of the shortcode. 
Most likely you will have a map file on your desktop in which case we will need to upload it to the plugin server. Open Map tools and select "Desktop upload." Upload your map and then go to the Shortcode tab and select the file you just uploaded.
In both cases press CTRL-A and then CTRL-C to copy the shortcode to the clipboard. Not paste this shortcode into your post or page.
